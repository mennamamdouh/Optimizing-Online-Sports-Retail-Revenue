## **The main strategy used in this project** ##

First, I've created a MySQL database which in data storage has been done. Then I've established a connection between MySQL server and Python. After that I've executed all queries in Python and retrieved the required data. Finally I've done the analysis and visualization using Python's libraries and packages.
